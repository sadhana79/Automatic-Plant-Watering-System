🌱 Automatic Plant Watering System
🗓️ Developed in 2023 | Uploaded for portfolio reference

An IoT-based project designed to automatically water plants based on soil moisture levels. It helps save water, ensures plant health, and reduces human effort by automating irrigation.

📌 Project Overview
This system uses:
Soil Moisture Sensor to monitor moisture levels
Arduino/NodeMCU for controlling the logic
Relay Module to switch the motor/pump
Water Pump to irrigate the plants
Optional LCD display to show current moisture level

Technologies & Components Used
Arduino IDE (C++)
Soil Moisture Sensor
Water Pump
Relay Module
Arduino UNO
Breadboard & Jumper Wires
Power Supply

📖 How It Works
The sensor detects soil moisture level.
If it's below a threshold, the microcontroller turns on the water pump.
Once moisture reaches a set level, the pump turns off.
This cycle runs continuously to keep the plant healthy.

💡 Future Enhancements
Add mobile app or web dashboard using IoT
Schedule watering with RTC (Real-Time Clock)
Solar-powered setup
