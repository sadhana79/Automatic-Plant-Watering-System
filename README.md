# 🚿 Automatic Plant Watering System – IoT Based Project
🗓️ Developed in 2022 | Uploaded for portfolio reference

An IoT-based project designed to automatically water plants based on soil moisture levels. It helps save water, ensures plant health, and reduces human effort by automating irrigation.

Project Overview

This system uses:
Soil Moisture Sensor to monitor moisture levels
Arduino/NodeMCU for controlling the logic
Relay Module to switch the motor/pump
Water Pump to irrigate the plants
Optional LCD display to show current moisture level

Technologies & Components Used
Arduino IDE (C++)
Soil Moisture Sensor
Water Pump
Relay Module
Arduino UNO
Breadboard & Jumper Wires
Power Supply

📖 How It Works
The sensor detects soil moisture level.
If it's below a threshold, the microcontroller turns on the water pump.
Once moisture reaches a set level, the pump turns off.
This cycle runs continuously to keep the plant healthy.

💡 Future Enhancements
Add mobile app or web dashboard using IoT
Schedule watering with RTC (Real-Time Clock)
Solar-powered setup
